# QueryBuilder

The inspiration of this repository comes from laziness and the needlessness of typing
the same, repetitive SQL queries in multiple places. 

QueryBuilder is designed to work on SQL SERVER only, and it will help generate dynamic
code of different styles. 


TO DO: 

    - Accept Excel/ CSV as input 
    - Automated Syntax Checker required
    - Unit tests?
